# SLES 12 SP5 to SLES 15 SP4 Offline Upgrade: Challenges & Internet Dependencies
### Key Challenges in Offline Upgrade
Migrating from SLES 12 SP5 to SLES 15 SP4 without internet presents several technical hurdles:
### 1. Dependency Hell
•	Many packages require newer dependencies not present in SLES 12.
•	Manual dependency resolution is tedious and error-prone.
### 2. Missing Migration Patterns
•	The `SUSE-migration-sles15` pattern may not be available in SLES 12 repos.
•	Requires manual download and transfer of RPMs.
### 3. Repository Conflicts
•	SLES 12 and SLES 15 have different repo structures.
•	Zypper may fail if old repos aren't properly disabled.
### 4. Third-Package Compatibility
•	Custom/third-party RPMs (e.g., SAP, Oracle) may break.
•	Vendor-provided migration guides are often internet-dependent.
### 5. Post-Upgrade Issues
•	Orphaned packages (`zypper packages --orphaned`) are common.
•	Services may fail to start due to config file changes.

## Internet Dependencies (Even in "Offline" Upgrades)
Despite being "offline," some steps still require internet access at some stage:
### 1. Initial Preparation
•	Downloading the SLES 15 SP4 ISO requires internet.
•	Obtaining migration RPMs (`SUSE-migration-sles15`) needs online access.
### 2. Registration & Licensing
•	SUSEConnect requires internet to validate subscriptions.
•	Workaround: Use RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) for air-gapped environments.
### 3. Post-Upgrade Patches
•	Critical security updates post-migration need internet.
•	Without them, the system may be vulnerable.

## Workarounds for True Offline Upgrades
### 1. Use SUSE RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool)
•	Mirror all required repos on an intermediate server with internet.
•	Point offline machines to this local mirror.
### 2. Manual RPM Transfers
•	Download required packages (`zypper --download-only`).
•	Transfer via USB/NFS to the target machine.
### 3. Preload All Dependencies
•	Use `zypper dup --download-in-advance` on an online machine.
•	Copy `/var/cache/zypper/packages` to the offline system.
### 4. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) Proxy
•	Set up a proxy server to cache packages.
•	Useful for enterprise environments.

## Best Practices for Reliable Offline Migration
1.	Test in a staging environment first
2.	Use `zypper verify` to detect broken dependencies
3.	Disable all third-party repos before migration
4.	Check `/var/log/zypper.log` for errors
5.	Have a rollback plan (snapshot/backup)
